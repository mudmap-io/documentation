Devices cannot be registered with Mudmap until there is a valid subscription in place. This 
section covers how to create the subscription, manage, cancel, and pricing structure.

## Pricing 

Mudmap is priced *per seat*, or rather, pay-for-what-you-use keeping your costs down.

Each device that has successfully been registered with Mudmap will be charged at $6 per month. 
Newly added devices will be calculated daily and at the end of the month will be automatically 
charged to the account.

For instance, if an account registers and connects one device during that month, the account 
will be debited $6 at month end. 

If an account connects 5 devices, that account will be charged 5 x $6, for a total of $30 for 
that month.

On the next month if the 5 is reduced to 3, the next month's bill will now be 3 x $6 equaling 
$18 dollars.

## Subscription Setup

Registering the first device will trigger a payment window, prompting the user to sign up for a 
monthly subscription. 

[Paddle] is responsible for all payments and subscriptions when using Mudmap.

During the subscription process the email provided during account registration will be used as 
your unique user reference for [Paddle] invoices. 

## Subscription Management

To Manage your account, head over to the `User Profile` page within Mudmap. See [here]
[user-profile] for more information about the `User Profile` page.

### Late payments

Late payemnts are given 7 days to rectify before losing access to Mudmap's functionality.

### Cancellations

To cancel your account navigate to the `User Profile` page and click `cancel subscription`. A 
[Paddle] window will appear with the option to cancel.

Cancellations will be honoured until the next subscription payment date. After that, Mudmap 
functionality will be diminished. 

Accounts cancelled for longer than 60 days are queued for permanent deletion.


Mudmap uses [Paddle] as its payment gateway. Using Paddle gives Mudmap
greater flexibility to provide you with better rates, effiecient tax
handling and the option to choose Credit Card or Paypal to make purchases.

:::note paypal support is coming
Paypal is supported by Paddle and at writing yet to be implemented into
Mudmap. It will be implemented but if it is a *show stopping* requirement for
you then
get
in touch via the [contact page][contact] and let me know.
:::

Paddle also handles all the security for your payments - rest assured
that your sensitive financial data is stored by Paddle not Mudmap. This also
means disputes, charge backs and fraudulent payments are handled by a company
geared for this, rather than relying on Mudmap.

What's this mean for you? All the support, security, payments and
invoices are all handled by Paddle. For more information refer to their
[website][paddle].


:::tip tl;dr
Payments are linked to your user account. There is no way to change this
yet, however it is on the roadmap. Please get [in touch][contact] if you
need to update your accounts email for payments.

### I have a payment issue

If you have a dispute, issue or query, the
first point of contact should be the [contact] page. Should it need more
attention, then Paddle can get involved and handle it with their own
customer service.
