title: Payment information
---

Mudmap now uses [Stripe] as its payment gateway. This means that all 
payment information such as credit card details are kept with Stripe. No 
one at Mudmap can access or see your financial data. We can see when you're 
renewal is coming and other payment specific data such as expiring cards.

After subscribing, you're nominated account will be charged according to 
the number of active devices in use on the account. The payment schedule 
starts on the day you begin the subscription. Each additional device is 
charged on that day - not at time of activation. This is done to make your 
reconciliation easier.

## Pricing

Mudmap is a *per-seat* pricing model. Each activated device - meaning you've 
connected your device to Mudmap's servers and are now able to send and 
receive data - will be added to your monthly charge. Devices which are 
removed from your account are deducted from the monthly amount. Pricing is 
prorated - you'll only pay for the portion of the month you used once a 
device is removed.

The pricing is graduated on the following schedule, per-month.

| Number of Devices | Cost per Device (USD) |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 - 25            | $6                    |
| 26 - 75           | $5.5                  |
| 76 - 150          | $5                    |
| 151 +             | $4.5                  |
