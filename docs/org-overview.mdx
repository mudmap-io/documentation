Mudmap now supports to concept of *Organisations*. This means multiple user accounts can be linked
to a single entity, the organisation. More simply, devices can be managed by multiple users as
long as they belong to the same organisation.

## How does it work?

When a user signs up for Mudmap an organisation is created, and they are then assigned to it. The
first user becomes the account owner and can add additional users to their organisation.

All users within the organisation can manage the devices within. Only account owners can manage
access to the organisation, and the billing functions.

## Management

Organisation owners can [update the name][orgname], [add] or [remove] users and
update [payment] details.

### Updating the organisation name

If you are the account owner, updating the name is as simple as navigating to the *Organisation*
tab and click *Update* in the Name row.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img  alt="Organisation change name" src=
    {useBaseUrl
    ('img/org-change-name.gif')} />
</div>

## Limitations

There are some limitations:

- Users must have a valid account within Mudmap before they can be assigned to an existing
organisation
- Only owners can add or remove users
- Billing and payment data can only be managed by the account owner
- Permissions per user, or by user type are in development.
- Only *owner* and *user* account types exist - if you need more owners in the organisation please get in [contact](mailto:dan@mudmap.io).
