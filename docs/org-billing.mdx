All accounts can see the Billing tab within Mudmaps settings page but **only** account owners can
make changes to it. The option to view, create or update subscriptions is removed from all non-owner
accounts.

If you are subscribed, it is here where you can update payment details or
cancel your subscription. Cancelling your subscription will still give you
access to the platform until the renewal date has passed. After which you
will be able to login but no device information will be presented to the
user interface.

Your data will be permanently deleted 60 days after your last subscription
renewal date has passed.
