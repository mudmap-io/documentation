title: Free tier
---

New users can add two (2) devices for free to test out Mudmap. No credit 
cards or time limits.

## How does it work?

Simply sign up and get started today. The two device limit lets you test 
out Mudmap and get a feel for it. No credit card required until you 
cross the threshold - you're third device.

### What happens when I add my third device?

You are not restricted from adding devices to Mudmap. But once you're over 
the threshold of *activated* devices, you will no longer be able to access 
*any* device until you've either subscribed, or until you are below the 
threshold.

Put simply, if you activate three devices and are not subscribed, you won't 
be able to use Mudmap as you did with two.

How do I subscribe? Head to the [profile] page in the dashboard and click 
**subscribe**. 

### Does this last forever?

Nothing lasts forever, but it's not going anywhere for a while. Any changes 
to the free tier will be well publicised and fair notice will be issued.
