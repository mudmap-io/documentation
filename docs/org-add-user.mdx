As an account owner you can add additional users to your organisation. This gives more users
oversight and shares the responsibility across more of your team.
This page discusses how the process works and explains the steps required to get started. Removing
existing users is covered here as well.

## The Process

To add additional users to your organisation, the account owner must first invite them through
email. After entering the users email into Mudmap's invitation dialog, an automated email is sent
to that address with joining instructions. Most importantly, their registration token is sent with
that email.

Once the user receives that email they must then enter it into the user settings page by clicking
on the <Highlight color="#4e45e4">Change Membership</Highlight> button. The user must then present
the token from their email, and if valid and if the token is not expired, they will be automatically
added to the organisation.

Users do not need a valid Mudmap account prior to being invited by the account owner.

Successfully registered users are sent a welcome email and account owners are notified that the
user joined the organisation.

## Inviting users

To add new users to your organisation, navigate to the Organisation tab inside the Settings page.

Clicking the <Highlight color="#4e45e4">Invite Member</Highlight> button will open a modal where
you can enter the email of the user you wish to invite.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img  alt="Organisation invite user" src=
    {useBaseUrl
    ('img/mudmap-invite-user.gif')} />
</div>

That user will be sent an email with instructions on how to register with the organisation, and the
registration token. The email will look something like this.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img  alt="Organisation invite user email" src=
    {useBaseUrl
    ('img/mudmap-invite-email.png')} />
</div>

## Registering with an organisation

Once a user has received the invitation email and [signed up](register-account) for Mudmap they can
complete the process to join the organisation.

From the Mudmap user settings page, click the <Highlight color="#4e45e4">Change
Membership</Highlight> button to launch the registration modal.

Entering the token into the modal and clicking <Highlight color="#4e45e4">Invite</Highlight> will
the complete the process and transfer that user to the organisation.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img  alt="Organisation invite user email" src=
    {useBaseUrl
    ('img/mudmap-register-new-user.gif')} />
</div>

Note that existing devices belonging to that user are **not** transferred across. If that user has
devices that they wish to be transferred, they must delete them and re-register them with the new
organisation.

## Viewing Membership

As an account owner, it is possible to both add and remove users. Only account owners can see other
members.

To see all your organisations members, naviagate to the Membership tab inside the Settings page.
A table similar to below should be visible.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img  alt="Organisation user membership table" src=
    {useBaseUrl
    ('img/mudmap-membership-table.png')} />
</div>

This table presents information about each user, and allows for the removal of accounts which
are no longer needed.

### Deleting Members

To delete a member of the organisation, navigate to the Membership tab inside the Settings page.
Clicking on the <Highlight color="#dc2626">Delete</Highlight> button will prompt the user that this
action is final. Once approved this user will immediately lose access to the organisation.

Account owners cannot delete themselves, either intentionally or be accident.
